## üí´ **Task**

- You are placed in a maze with a starting point S.

- You need to find your way to goal G AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE (as few cells as possible) and collect some coins on the way.

- Walls are X, each cell in a passage has some coins 0 to 9. Outside maze is lava.

- Moves are 1 unit each.

- You are ALLOWED TO MOVE DIAGONALLY.

- Solution should be sum of coins collected on the way out of maze.

- If there are multiple solutions with same number of moves, the solution with LEAST coins collected needed.

- Write a program to solve the maze.

## ‚ö° **Complexity**

- Time complexity: O(rows\*cols \* log(rows*cols))
- Space complexity: O(rows*cols)
